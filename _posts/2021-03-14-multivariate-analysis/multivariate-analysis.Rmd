title: "Multivariate Analysis"
description: |
  For the final project in EMS 263 I created and ran a Multivariate Analysis model to find the watersheds in Southern Santa Barbara County that would be suitable for conservation. Displayed below are images of my final anaylsis. They include: 1) a map of watersheds that are suitable for conservation efforts, 2) a Multivariate Analysis Super Model that includes three other models as algorithms, 3) the riparian model/algorithm, 4) the viewshed model/algorithm, and 5) the developable land model/algorithm.
