I highly recommmend *The Kingkiller Chronicle* book series if you enjoy reading fantasy. Reading the coder's notes that I included will not spoil the first book anynmore than a backcover would. If you are someone that avoids starting unfinished series you may want to wait to read the first two, however, I believe it still worth the read.",
